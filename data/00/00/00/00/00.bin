  |   RemiLore is a "rogue-lite" anime-style adventure set in a colorful    |
  |   fantasy world where players hack-and-slash their way through an       |
  |   army of mechanical monsters using a huge variety of unique melee      |
  |   weapons and devastating magic attacks!                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Remi, an ordinary high school student, has awakened Lore, a talking   |
  |   book who is a self-proclaimed "master" of magic. Together, they are   |
  |   drawn into the magical world of Ragnoah, which has been overtaken     |
  |   by nefarious mecha-monsters. Remi and Lore must venture together      |
  |   and find their way home, but can Remi really trust the mischievous    |
  |   magic book Lore? Who is the mysterious android girl "Choux" and why   |
  |   does she want to capture Lore? Will Remi ever find her way out of     |
  |   the magical world and return home?                                    |
  |                                                                         |

  |   two-player co-op mode, upgradable spells and bonus traits, and        |
  |   procedurally-generated levels in four beautifully rendered worlds,    |
  |   each based on one of the four seasons. Defeating mecha-monsters has   |
  |   its rewards, too - players can uncover loads of unlockables,          |
  |   including alternate costumes, 200+ collectible weapons, New Game+     |
  |   modes, and more!                                                      |
